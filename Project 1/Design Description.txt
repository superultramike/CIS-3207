SYNOPSIS
	MYps is a program is simple version of the ps command. It is executed from the commandline 
	and has a variety of functions to display for any said process

DESCRIPTION
		As stated above the user can provide an variety of arguments to the program to execute.
	All user input is sourced through a while loop that calls the getopt function to seek a user input character
	Once getopt finds the specific character in the cmdline using a switch case, it will raise a flag to be
	referred to late once the beginning argument scanning is done. MYps has two main roads that the user can go on.
	The user can either input one PID and have it's info displayed or no PID can be provided and all the info of all
	processes will be displayed. I will explain these two main divergent "roads" below
