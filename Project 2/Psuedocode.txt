1: Start figuring out how to get user input one line at a time (hint: getline)
2: Implement tokenizer to return user input as white-space delimited tokens
3: implement some of the easier built in commands
4: implement a basic parser that will run built-ins with given number of arguments
  // Function to execute builtin commands
  int ownCmdHandler(char** parsed)
  4.1: alert user if they enter an invalid number of arguments for a built in command
  
5: Finish the rest of the built-in commands and make sure they work
6: start by implementing fork() when command isn't built in
7: then implement exec() and wait() once you've figured out fork
8: then shell can execute both built-ins and external commands
9: it will be easier to implement flag handling once core shell is programmed
