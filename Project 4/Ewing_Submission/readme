TESTING
	In terms of testing I wanted to test in short and long term intervals with the short interval
	being about 10 secs and then a long term interval being about 30 secs. Give how fast and how quickly
	the program produces signals, I'd say 30 secs is a fairly long time to produce more then 500 signals
	or more.
	
	To view testing results for short 10 sec test, view the text files within the "10 secs data" folder
	
	To view testing results for long 30 sec test, view the text files within the "30 secs data" folder

DISCUSSION
	Involving a discussion with this type of testing needs to acknowledge the capabilities of possible bias
	or the general conditions to produce said results. The computer that I ran these tests on were on a 
	typical "gaming" PC with high performance in CPU speed, RAM speed, in addition to a fast SSD M.2 drive.
	So given those general conditions it makes sense that the following tests would perform accurately given
	that the amount of lines present in the sent_signa file matches the amount of lines in the received_signal
	file, meaning that we successfully sent and received the correct amount for each test even while producing
	15-18 signals a second with good timing on print outs. As a result of this successful test, signal loss was
	non-existent.
